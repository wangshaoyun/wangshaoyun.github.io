I have coded some programs by Fortran and MATLAB, for more than 50000 lines and 10000 lines respectively, in molecular simulation and numerical computation. Moreover, due to my graduate major is theoretical physics, I am familiar with basic physics subjects such as quantum field theory, quantum mechanics, statistical mechanics . Finally, as a hard-working student, I spent more than 14 hours on research and study each day.

My research area is computational and theoretical study of polymers. I have developed Monte Carlo method for weak polyelectrolytes. The particles can be simulated is improved from hundreds to tens of thousands. This work is still ongoing and will be published in future. In addition, I have used molecular dynamics to simulate charged polyelectrolytes. One paper is published in*Soft Matter*, one paper is submitted to *Journal of Applied Physics* and is under reviewing, other three manuscripts are just finished and to be submitted soon. Moreover, I have done some research on solid mechanics and I have published 7 IEEE papers, 1 SCI paper and 2 patents.

My research interest is wide, whatever in condensed matter physics, computational physics, astrophysics or other physics, because different objects seems similar from a high standpoint. However, I have a little prejudice that my interest is theoretical. I like to use several basic physical principles, some mathematical techniques and computational tools to explain natural phenomenon, develop methods, construct connections between theories and so on.
